With the rapid launch of PCL branch versions, UI restoration has become a major challenge for many developers. PCL.Proto emerges as a solution.

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This project is based on [PCL2](https://github.com/Hex-Dragon/PCL2) and [PCL2-CE](https://github.com/PCL-Community/PCL2-CE), with a goal of providing a standardized prototype sample for each PCL branch version. The repository is built using Vue3, and if your project uses Webview as the frontend, you can directly reference this project.

The project is also ready for preview at [PCL.Proto](https://www.amagicpear.sbs/PCL.Proto/).

## Prototype

If your PCL branch version or your custom launcher is not based on Web technology, referencing this repository directly might have limited convenience. You may head to [js.design - 「PCL.Prototype」](https://js.design/f/QVPQRY?p=zX2rcVk6Cy&mode=design) to view the specific application prototype, export the cut image or refer to the style code generated by it.

In case you would like to modify the prototype design file, you are welcome to [click this link](https://js.design/ti?c=tS-6qs0WDQJ3H4) to join the team.

## Project Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> First, please ensure that `nodejs` or `bun` is installed on your device. If you use `npm` as the package manager, you can replace all `bun` commands below with `npm`.
> Additionally, you need to ensure that the `rust` toolchain is installed on your device. If you have any questions, please refer to [Prerequisites | Tauri](https://tauri.app/zh-cn/start/prerequisites/).

Currently, the project is a Tauri + Vue3 + Vite project. Before running the project for the first time, please run the following command to install the front-end dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

The backend dependencies will be managed by `cargo` automatically.

Then, use `bun run tauri icon` to automatically generate icons. You can then start the development and build processes.

> [!WARNING]
> The icons in this repository are excluded. Therefore, if you do not perform this step after cloning the repository, the `icons` folder will be empty, and the Tauri application will throw an error when it starts!

### Hot Reload Development

```sh
bun run tauri dev
```

## HELP WANTED!!

I want to make this project into a Vue component npm package, but I don't know how to do it. If there are any experts who can do component libraries, please contact me! Thank you!
